# asyn - A simple asynchronous event manager
#
# Asyn doesn't solve the world.
# It's meant to effectively (and stylishly) deal with common cases.
#
# Asyn provides runloop-style asynchronous processing through callback
# hierarchies. If you understand how select(2)/poll(2) work, you won't
# find this hard to work with.
# Controller is the run loop. Selectables manage file descriptors for
# the Controller. There's a simple timer facility. Everything's ultimately
# based on delivering callbacks to arbitrary Python callables.
#
# The one surprising feature is that Selectables have Scanners, which
# provide a processing facility for incoming input. Scannable.scan can be
# set to a Scanner object at any time, which lets you switch between parsing
# rule sets by switching Scanners. If no Scanner is set for a Selectable,
# an internal default is used, which usually delivers data as it arrives.
