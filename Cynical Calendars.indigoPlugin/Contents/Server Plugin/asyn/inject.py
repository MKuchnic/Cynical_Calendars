# It adds the ability to "inject" code for execution from another thread
# without disturbing its serene single-threaded happiness.

class Controller(asyn.Controller):
	""" A Controller that allows other threads to inject work into it.

		This is a standard Controller that can interact with other threads.
		It allows any thread to inject calls into its schedule queue, either
		asynchronous or with the calling thread waiting for the outcome.

		Note that even for the waiting versions, the actual call is still
		made on the controller thread (with the result being transferred to
		the waiting caller).

		The queue_idle construction argument determines what injection does
		when the Controller is not running. If queue_idle is False (the default),
		other threads will directly execute their injection. The caller is responsible
		for avoiding thread contention on the data used. If queue_idle is True,
		injections will be queued, but will not execute until the Controller is
		resumed. The waiting versions of injection will wait until that happens.
