		Selectable represents a file descriptor of some sort. Once inserted
		into a Controller, it becomes eligible for event calls as I/O activity
		becomes available for it.

		Selectable itself does not have an attribute that holds the file descriptor.
		The subclass must provide a fileno() method that returns it.

		Selectable itself has no read or write behavior. Subclasses define this.

		Subclasses of Selectable use their Callable personality to deliver input.

		Selectable sends out a 'CLOSE' context (with no arguments) when it is closed.

		The empty input condition is delivered separately through the _null_read
		method. In most situations, that's an end or error condition; but a few
		devices can continue to read after that. The default _null_read will close
		the Selectable; override it for odder handling.	All of this is quite UNIX-specific,
		of course.
